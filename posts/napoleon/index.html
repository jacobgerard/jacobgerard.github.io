<p>Napoleon was one of the most influential figures in history. He was a general
who rarely lost battles and did not needlessly start wars (most were declared
on him). He had a constant desire to be doing work and was extremely well read
and interested in a multitude of subjects. Many of his actions impacted the
next century in Europe and led to military formations and administration that
is still with us today.</p>
<h3 id="actionable-notes">Actionable Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read more. Napoleon read all the time and was extremely well-versed in his
ancient history.</li>
<li>Constantly be learning something new.</li>
<li>Do not meddle in other people&rsquo;s love lives.</li>
<li>Do not become too arrogant/stick to guiding principles. He lost later wars
because he could not follow his own military maxims.</li>
<li>Do not blindly trust family or give people limitless opportunities to prove
their worth.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="good-quotes">Good Quotes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since the campaign had begun a year earlier, Napoleon had crossed the
Apennines and the Alps, defeated a Sardinian army and no fewer than six
Austrian armies, and killed, wounded or captured 120,000 Austrian soldiers.
<strong>All this he had done before his twenty-eighth birthday.</strong> Eighteen months
earlier he had been an unknown, moody soldier writing essays on suicide; now
he was famous across Europe, having defeated mighty Austria, wrung peace
treaties from the Pope and the kings of Piedmont and Naples, abolished the
medieval dukedom of Modena, and defeated in every conceivable set of military
circumstances most of Austria’s most celebrated generals – Beaulieu, Wurmser,
Provera, Quasdanovich, Alvinczi, Davidovich – and outwitted the Archduke
Charles.</li>
<li>In an unscripted speech to the Conseil in 1806, which he made only because
his education minister, Antoine Fourcroy, hadn’t brought his report to the
meeting, Napoleon was almost poetic about how education was the most
important of all the institutions, since everything depends upon it, the
present and the future. It is essential that the morals and political ideas
of the generation which is now growing up should no longer be dependent on
the news of the day or the circumstances of the moment&hellip; Men already differ
enough in their inclinations, their characters and everything that education
does not give and cannot reform&hellip; Let us have a body of doctrine that
doesn’t vary and a body of teachers that doesn’t die.</li>
<li>Alsatian Jews made up nearly half of France’s Jewish population of 55,000,
and they were blamed for ‘excessive’ usury in that curious inversion whereby
people who borrow money under free contracts in an open market blame those
who lend it to them.</li>
<li>‘Society in the salons is always in a state of hostility against the
government. Everything is criticized and nothing praised.’</li>
<li>He was adamant that his role in international affairs was over. ‘History has
a triumvirate of great men,’ Macnamara stated, ‘Alexander, Caesar, and
Napoleon.’ At this, Napoleon looked steadfastly at him without speaking, and
Macnamara said ‘he thought he saw the Emperor’s eyes moisten.’</li>
