        <p>I&rsquo;m a computer science graduate interested in cyber security and systems programming. I don&rsquo;t currently work in a technical role that would be beneficial to getting a job in the cyber field. There is a plan in place for that to change in the next few years, but in the meantime I figured that a blog would give me a platform to showcase my studies, projects, and research. It will also (hopefully) motivate me to keep moving in the right direction during my free time!</p>
<p>I expect that the majority of my posts here will be short updates on what I&rsquo;ve been researching, interesting challenges or courses I&rsquo;ve finished, and comments on current events in the industry. All this comes with the ambitious goal of eventually passing the OSCP. I don&rsquo;t know if it is possible in the next few years, but setting my sights high will at least put me in a comfortable position for when I transition to a new career field down the road.</p>
<p>If you are interested in any of my posts, have advice for the best ways to move forward, or just want to chat, then feel free to send me an email. I&rsquo;m looking forward to hopping into the work and hope to share some good bits of information with you soon.</p>
