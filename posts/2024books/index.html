        <p>In the past few years I&rsquo;ve set some pretty high reading goals for myself (23 in 2023 and 24 in 2024) and came up short each time. Basically I&rsquo;ve started out each year strong but then got sidetracked by work, learning other things, and pure laziness come late-summer. I still learned a lot and enjoyed the books I&rsquo;ve read each year, but obviously want to push myself to read more. Without going to look up the stats, I think I heard that around 10,000 books come out each year and the average American reads less than 10. I am trying to change this for myself since I appreciate the longer form content and feel that I get a lot more out of it.</p>
<p>To be fair to myself I have still done mostly productive things with that time in both 2023 and 2024. But I have either made excuses to stop reading during the busier times or just hit the wall with whatever book I was currently on. This coming year I am aiming to change that by loosening the restrictions on type of books I consume. I have sporadically maintained a list of want-to-reads on Goodreads which informed my choices in the past. But in 2025 I am hoping to just pick up whatever looks interesting and that I will power through at the time. I still hope to do a decent split between fiction and non-fiction; but won&rsquo;t be limiting myself to that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to get started on it and am also aiming to write my updates here (along with whether I am ahead or behind) to stay motivated throughout the year. The official goal will once again match up with the year; so 25 in &lsquo;25!</p>
<p>Without further ado here are my lists for the past two years:</p>
<h2 id="2023">2023</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Innovators - Walter Isaacson</li>
<li>2001: A Space Odyssey - Arthur C. Clarke</li>
<li>Chip War - Chris Miller</li>
<li>Red Rising - Pierce Brown</li>
<li>The Rise of Athens - Anthony Everitt</li>
<li>Catcher in the Rye - J.D. Salinger</li>
<li>Golden Son - Pierce Brown</li>
<li>Morning Star - Pierce Brown</li>
<li>Dune: Messiah - Frank Herbert</li>
<li>Six Frigates - Ian Toll</li>
<li>Sandworm - Andy Greenberg</li>
<li>The Name of the Wind - Patrick Rothfuss</li>
<li>Old Man&rsquo;s War - John Scalzi</li>
<li>Fourth Wing - Rebecca Yarros</li>
<li>A Brief Guide to Maritime Strategy - James R. Holmes</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that the best books I read were either the first <em>Red Rising</em> trilogy or <em>The Name of the Wind</em>. Unfortunately with the latter there are only two books released and it has been a long time since Patrick Rothfuss released the second. So maybe hold out on this series for the time being if you need closure.</p>
<h2 id="2024">2024</h2>
<p>This was the first year that I ever used audiobooks to consume content. It was nice to finish out some of them without needing to sit down and read the entire thing and I honestly don&rsquo;t think I missed out too much on taking notes. I wouldn&rsquo;t do it for a book that I absolutely wanted to get all the nuggets of wisdom from, but there are plenty on my want-to-read list that I will consider audio for.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear - Patrick Rothfuss</li>
<li>How Big Things Get Done - Bent Flyvbjerg</li>
<li>Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World - David Epstein</li>
<li>The Slow Regard of Silent Things - Patrick Rothfuss</li>
<li>The Exponential Age - Azeem Azhar</li>
<li>War at the Speed of Light - Louis A. Del Monte</li>
<li>Team of Teams - Stanley McChrystal</li>
<li>The Song of Achilles - Madeline Miller</li>
<li>Stolen Focus - Johann Hari</li>
<li>The Sun Also Rises - Ernest Hemingway</li>
<li>Trillions - Robin Wigglesworth</li>
<li>Thinking In Systems - Donella Meadows</li>
<li>Iron Gold - Pierce Brown</li>
<li>SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome - Mary Beard</li>
<li>Software Engineering at Google</li>
<li>Dark Age - Pierce Brown</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite book of 2024 was pretty easily <em>How the Big Things Get Done</em>. It was very informative, had lots of interesting anecdotes, and was made relatable to everyday life. There were a few other good ones in the mix, but that would be my big recommendation.</p>
