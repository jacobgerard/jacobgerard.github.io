      <div class="post-content">
        <p>This is a short summary of all the things I&rsquo;ve been working on for the past
year. It was a packed schedule for all aspects of my life, and taking time at
the end of the day to sit down and learn something new wasn&rsquo;t always the top
priority. But I was able to squeeze in a few useful topics that have been fun
in my time off work. Most of the coding and technology skills were used to
build out my home website.</p>
<h2 id="computing">Computing</h2>
<p>For a little over a year I have been internally hosting a Flask website that
takes in expense data and tracks savings progress in Python. This all hooks in
to a SQLite database which I can query or run simple analytics on to track my
financial goals. It started out very basic with Jinja templates that would show
the results of queries, but has since grown to support almost all of my
financial needs.</p>
<p>During the first half of the year I decided to really step it up. I optimized
the back end and made more efficient use of SQL queries. During the late spring
and early summer I learned JavaScript basics and wrote an API layer so that I
could run Asynchronous queries and update the DOM to reflect this. I improved
the overall layout of the site with more refined CSS. Then, towards the end of
the year, I again improved on the layout and fixed all the spaghetti code that
I wrote to manage the single page application sections. I also began to study a
little bit of data science and plotting with matplotlib and used that to write
an awesome year end summary in LaTeX.</p>
<p>These skills sort of moved all over the place, but I basically did a slow build
up from an idea that I had last year. I was tired of trying to track things
across different Excel pages and knew that a database would be a more elegant
solution. I progressively built a web application that could cleanly represent
my data and motivate me to progress quickly to my savings goals. Currently the
site inputs and updates expenses, tracks budgets, retrieves savings and net
worth numbers, and charts out growth. I can filter queries and easily navigate
through the main functions.</p>
<p>On top of that, I can proudly say that I wrote all the front end code for this
website by hand (including the CSS) to eliminate any calls to outside libraries
like Bootstrap. The back end is Python that uses Flask to serve the application
and feeds off business logic that I wrote for a command line version of the
budgeting software. All this is self-hosted on my Fedora desktop and served
through an NGINX web server.</p>
<p>I will continue to build features onto this site throughout 2023. The primary
thing I&rsquo;m missing is a nice way to check on my investment data within the web
app. I think that I will be able to build out a few pages that either track
what I already have at the beginning of each month, or potentially log into the
sites and scrape my investment data into the app. I&rsquo;ll take a break at the
beginning of the year, but will probably hit the ground running on that in
February.</p>
<p>I would love to upload this project to my GitHub page, but due to the sensitive
nature of financial data I have been reluctant to do that for fear that I left
some major identifying information in the code. I will be attempting to go
through and clean my git repo so that this can be made public. There are other
projects that can do this better; but I have learned a lot while implementing
this and it fits my needs nicely.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read 13 books and wrote up 3 posts with notes and quotes! I&rsquo;ll link those
here and then post my impressions of a few of the others that I learned a good
deal from. I highly recommend <em>The Psychology of Money</em> by Morgan Housel as I
think everybody can get a lot out of it. Plus its a fairly quick read.</p>

<li>Good stories about how to be more successful in personal finances by
staying the course and recognizing that some people or industries just
get lucky. Long term investing is the surest path to success and you need
to save just for unexpected life events, not necessarily only for big
purchases.</li>

<li>Success is tough to achieve just by hard work alone. Most of the
extremely successful people in the world had very unusual circumstances
that put them in positions to be the best at something right when it was
necessary. There is not much to do to control that. But it also points
out that the people you surround yourself with are very likely to have a
large impact on your standing in the world.</li>

<li>Stunning overview of very complicated math and science in an easily

tough problems with a new lens about how they all fit together into grand
theories of the universe.</li>

<p>I have also spent a fair amount of time listening to a few podcasts that
interest me. Sticking with the theme of finances, I love the Rational Reminder
podcast and try to listen to each episode as they come out weekly. I also fit
in a few episodes of Hardcore History by Dan Carlin. They are longer shows, but
packed with tons of information and tell history in a way that you usually
can&rsquo;t get from anywhere else unless you want to read textbooks all day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read the Wall Street Journal (almost daily), Foreign Affairs, The
Economist (in the last quarter of the year), and a few articles from the US
Naval Institute Proceedings. Next year, I am going to cut down on the
newspapers and magazines that I read in order to fit in more books. Aiming for
23 in 2023 after inspiration from the folks at the Rational Reminder podcast.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>That is basically a summary of my year in learning for 2022. I tried to get up
and learn something new each week. There are lots of little lessons in there
that I learned throughout as well, but not everything merits a comment on this
blog. I plan to keep pushing myself further next year. The one area where I
didn&rsquo;t take much advantage of my time was keeping this site up to date. I will
try to get better with that and may post some smaller articles about simple
topics as how-to references for myself and anybody else who happens to stumble
on these notes. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or
recommendations for things that I can take a look at. Always looking for new
knowledge!</p>
