      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve set some pretty high reading goals for myself (23 in 2023 and 24 in 2024) and came up short each time. Basically I&amp;rsquo;ve started out each year strong but then got sidetracked by work, learning other things, and pure laziness come late-summer. I still learned a lot and enjoyed the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read each year, but obviously want to push myself to read more. Without going to look up the stats, I think I heard that around 10,000 books come out each year and the average American reads less than 10. I am trying to change this for myself since I appreciate the longer form content and feel that I get a lot more out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;by-john-keay&#34;&gt;By John Keay&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;impressions&#34;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese have had an extremely well detailed history due to their fantastic&#xA;record keeping. Their civilization has been extremely successful, relatively&#xA;continuous, and greatly influential around the world. They seem to specialize&#xA;in taking ideas from all over and improving on them for personal gain. The&#xA;current ruling power of the CCP has a much different take on Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Mandate&#xA;to rule, but they are still interested in how history can be twisted to justify&#xA;current foreign policy positions. I learned a lot about the geography and why&#xA;their society has advanced differently than Western powers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;by-jack-weatherford&#34;&gt;By Jack Weatherford&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;impressions&#34;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Mongols had an enormous impact on the world around them. They proved that a&#xA;Steppe people could conquer better due to their speed on the battlefield. They&#xA;also took skills from all areas of their empire to expand capabilities,&#xA;commerce, and improve the lives of all their subjects. They fell prey to&#xA;internal rivalries and losing their military ways after a few generations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;actionable-notes&#34;&gt;Actionable Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Always learn from adversaries and do not be afraid to try new tactics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Controlling propaganda and the narrative around a goal is just as important&#xA;as the tactics used to achieve the goal itself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do not allow enemies a chance to regroup and learn from an initial assault.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;good-quotes&#34;&gt;Good Quotes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether measured by the total number of people defeated, the sum of the&#xA;countries annexed, or by the total area occupied, Genghis Khan conquered more&#xA;than twice as much as any other man in history.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In order to cut through traditional rivalries and feuds in Athens,&#xA;Cleisthenes abolished the tribes and reassigned everyone to ten units of ten,&#xA;thereby transforming a tribal city into a city-state that grew into the&#xA;strongest military, commercial, artistic, and intellectual power along the&#xA;eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Virtually the same reform would&#xA;produce even more astonishing results for the Mongols on the steppes of Inner&#xA;Asia.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The postal service ranked alongside the military in importance for the&#xA;Mongols, and individual Mongols were allowed to serve in it in lieu of&#xA;regular military service.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In contrast to the massive infantry armies that moved slowly and fought along&#xA;a particular front or on a specific battlefield, the Mongols practiced&#xA;warfare across the entire territory, and the ensuing turmoil and confusion&#xA;allowed the Mongols to employ clever trickery of all sorts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You may conquer an army with superior tactics and men, but you can conquer a&#xA;nation only by conquering the hearts of the people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mongke recognized the dangers incurred by earlier administrations that issued&#xA;paper money and debt on an ad hoc basis, and in 1253 he created a Department&#xA;of Monetary Affairs to control and standardize the issuance of paper money.&#xA;The superintendent of the agency centralized control to prevent the overissue&#xA;of paper money and the erosion of its value through inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Supposedly, because of the importance of narcotics for the Ismailis, the&#xA;people around them called them hashshashin, meaning “the hashish users.” Over&#xA;time, this name became modified into the word assassin. Whether the killers&#xA;had actually used hashish to inspire them or not, the name spread into many&#xA;languages as the word for the murderer of high officials.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Mongol army had accomplished in a mere two years what the European&#xA;Crusaders from the West and the Seljuk Turks from the East had failed to do&#xA;in two centuries of sustained effort. They had conquered the heart of the&#xA;Arab world. No other non-Muslim troops would conquer Baghdad or Iraq again&#xA;until the arrival of the American and British forces in 2003.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cities of the Khwarizm empire had been a particularly important center&#xA;for mathematic scholarship; the word algorithm was derived from al Khwarizm.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;General literacy increased during the Mongol dynasty, and the volume of&#xA;literary material grew proportionately.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Mongol armies destroyed the uniqueness of the civilizations around them&#xA;by shattering the protective walls that isolated one civilization from&#xA;another and by knotting the cultures together.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;by-andrew-roberts&#34;&gt;By Andrew Roberts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;impressions&#34;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Napoleon was one of the most influential figures in history. He was a general&#xA;who rarely lost battles and did not needlessly start wars (most were declared&#xA;on him). He had a constant desire to be doing work and was extremely well read&#xA;and interested in a multitude of subjects. Many of his actions impacted the&#xA;next century in Europe and led to military formations and administration that&#xA;is still with us today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
